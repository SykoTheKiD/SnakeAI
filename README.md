## AI uses Reinforcement Learning to beat the snake game

### How do I get set up? ###

-- Run `pip install requirements -r requirements.txt` to get all the dependencies in order

-- Open `index.html` in your browser

-- Run `main.py` this will run the genetic algorithm and the snake will get better as it runs

#### INFO: 
OpenCV currently expects a 1920 x 1080 screen with the browser taking half the screen from the left this will me fixed in a later release
