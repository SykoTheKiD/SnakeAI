## AI uses Reinforcement Learning to beat the snake game

### Description:
Snake AI uses a Genetic Algorithm (Neural Evolution) to launch an initial population of 10,000 games it plays and adjusts the weights of the best performing ones and reporoduces them until a successful score of 2000 is reached.

Trained on a Tesla V100 for 2.3 hours.

### How do I get set up? ###

-- Run `pip install requirements -r requirements.txt` to get all the dependencies in order

-- Open `index.html` in your browser

-- Run `main.py` this will run the genetic algorithm and the snake will get better as it runs

#### INFO: 
OpenCV currently expects a 1920 x 1080 screen with the browser taking half the screen from the left this will me fixed in a later release
